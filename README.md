This package is designed to assist users of the [SMASH](https://smash-transport.github.io/) and [JETSCAPE/X-SCAPE](https://jetscape.org/) codes to analyze the output of the simulation data.
It contains multiple classes to read in the simulation outputs in OSCAR2013/OSCAR2013Extended format or the hadron output of JETSCAPE/X-SCAPE.
